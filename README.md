# Simply Elements
## Inspiration
The inspiration for SimplyElements is that i make it a simple and fun quiz for "Elements of The Periodic Table". With shop and timer system to make the game more fun!

## What it does
SimplyElements gives a fun, engaging, and educating gameplay with simple GUI. The elements are from number 1 to 118. With shop and timer to make the game more challenging.

## How we built it
I built it using Python and **tkinter, json, and random** module. The **tkinter** module is for the gui and messagebox, **json** module is for accessing the `elements.json` file (list of all the elements), and **random** module is for making the questions are random.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Handling errors related to missing or corrupted .json files.
2. Creating the GUI using tkinter

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Im proud of the accessing the `elements.json` file

## What we learned
I learned about how to make gui with **tkinter** in python, and accessing json file

## What's next for SimplyElements
1. Making it using `.html` as next version of SimplyElements in web browser
2. Make the `elements.json` file encrypted so user cannot cheat by seeing the `elements.json`
